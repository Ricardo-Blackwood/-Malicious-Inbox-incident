# -Malicious-Inbox-incident

Hands-On with Microsoft Sentinel | Cybersecurity Lab Project ðŸ›¡

Just wrapped up a lab where I worked inside Microsoft Sentinel, configuring and triaging a "Malicious Inbox" incident.

âœ… Elevated the incident from Medium to High severity

âœ… Set status to Active to initiate real-time response

âœ… Assigned it to the appropriate team member to ensure rapid remediation

âœ… Practiced incident prioritization and triage â€” key skills in any Security Operations Center (SOC) environment

This project gave me deeper insight into how SIEM tools like Sentinel play a crucial role in threat detection, response coordination, and incident management.
